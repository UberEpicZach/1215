 bm_1337_lion_and_lilies_desc:1 "Seven years ago, the boy-king Edward of England overthrew the tyrannical regime of his mother, princess Isabella of France, and her ambitious lover, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March.\n\nBut now, the young lion finds himself facing an even greater nemesis: Philip of Valois, the Most Christian King of France. The son of a second son, the untimely deaths of his three cousins in short succession have brought Philip a kingdom in turmoil.\n\nLong have the Plantagenets ruled in Aquitaine, but Edward has broken with tradition and refused to acknowledge the French king as his feudal superior. Seeking to bring his wayward vassal to heel, Philip has declared the English possessions forfeit.\n\nIn retaliation, Edward has named Philip an usurper and declared himself the true heir to the throne of his grandfather, Philip IV of France, the Iron King. There can be no negotiations: the victor will be determined on the battlefield.\n\n#bold It is an age of chivalry and blood: be swift and strong in war, noble and wise in peace, and above all else, show no mercy to your enemies.#!"

 bm_1337_stolenthrone_desc:0 "For sixty-seven years, starting with the deposition of Frederick II by Innocent IV, the Holy Roman Empire was without an emperor. Competitors as far-flung and varied as Alfonso of Castile, Charles of Valois, Richard of Cornwall, and Ottokar of Bohemia fought and schemed for this rich prize, all without success. Ultimately, grown weary of the strife, the electors agreed upon a compromise candidate: Henry VII of Luxembourg, a Frenchman from the western reaches of the empire.\n\n Desirous of restoring the empire's primacy over Italy, Henry led an army into the peninsula, but despite his successes his efforts were ultimately doomed to failure: only a year after his coronation, Henry died of malaria while laying siege to Siena. Henry's teenage son, John, had recently obtained the kingdom of Bohemia, but was unable to persuade the electors to allow him to succeed his father in an imperial title: instead, it became a battlefield between Louis, Duke of Bavaria, and the Habsburg rulers of Austria.\n\n Wittelsbach triumphed over Habsburg, but even after ten years on the throne, Louis' position is insecure. John of Bohemia is desirous of reclaiming his father's crown, and the Habsburgs have not forgotten their past ambitions..."

 bm_1337_glorythatwasgreece_desc:0 "In Constantinople, a ruler of Christ-like imperiousness presides over the last bastion of a thousand-year old empire that once spanned the four corners of the world. The purple-born world-ruler Andronikos III looks to the south and east to reclaim the lands lost to the infidel Turks by his predecessors. Will the eagle of Rome once more soar over the mountains of Anatolia? \n\n But the heirs of the Caesars are not without rivals. In the north, Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria sees in himself the makings of a second Simeon the Great, and none thus far have been able to disillusion him. In the west looms an even greater threat, however: the young ruler of Serbia, Stefan Dušan, has been endowed by God with every natural advantage, for he is like Hercules in strength, Odysseus in cunning, and Adonis in beauty. If he sets his eyes on the crown of Constantine, then he may prove unstoppable. \n\n Across the wine-dark sea, the manifold branches of the Angevin oak coil inwards upon themselves, each seeking to strangle its rivals to ensure its own survival. King Robert of Naples has been called a second Solomon in his wisdom and learning, but will his young granddaughter and heir Joanna sit so securely on his throne? With family like this, who needs enemies?"

The Iron King's sons left daughters, married to the powerful feudal magnates of Burgundy and Flanders and Navarre, and now he has become embroiled in a dispute with his most powerful vassal,  Edward of England, ruler over Aquitaine and Guyenne.

Unquestioning in his obedience to his liege, the French king, utterly contemptuous of his inferiors, and brave to the point of idiocy in battle. Unfortunately for Louis, the domain he ostensibly rules over is in Flanders, where the merchant prince is king, and the aristocracy gently humored, at best, and violently deposed, at worst.
